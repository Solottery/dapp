                        If you ticket has the play multiplier of 2 its two entries in the lottery for you.

                        then the whole lottery would be over. We decided to run the lottery over a longer period
                        of time.

                        It varies, we will manage our jackpot funds carefully so we can run the project over a
                        long time. Most of the prices are Solana coins but we plan to make special jackpots with
                        NFTs. The amount which can be won will be published right after the announcement of the
                        previous winner. Take a look at the rare NFTs where the jackpot can get multiplied up to
                        x2. Later the prices will be decided by the Solottery DAO.
